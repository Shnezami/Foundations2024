        <h3>Facial Treatments</h3>
        <p>Our facial treatments are designed to rejuvenate your skin and leave you feeling refreshed. The process often begins with a thorough cleansing to remove dirt, oil, and impurities from the skin's surface, followed by gentle exfoliation to slough away dead skin cells and reveal a smoother complexion underneath.</p>

        <h3>Acne Treatment</h3>
        <p>We offer personalized acne treatment plans to help you achieve clear and radiant skin. Acne treatment encompasses a range of strategies aimed at managing and reducing the occurrence of acne breakouts, as well as minimizing the appearance of existing blemishes. Acne, a common skin condition, occurs when hair follicles become clogged with oil and dead skin cells, leading to the formation of pimples, blackheads, and whiteheads.

            One approach to acne treatment involves a consistent skincare routine that includes gentle cleansing to remove excess oil, dirt, and impurities from the skin's surface. Exfoliation can also help to unclog pores and remove dead skin cells, preventing the buildup of debris that can contribute to acne.
            
            In addition to skincare, topical treatments such as over-the-counter or prescription-strength creams, gels, or lotions may be recommended to target acne-causing bacteria, reduce inflammation, and regulate oil production. Common ingredients found in acne treatments include benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, retinoids, and antibiotics.</p>
